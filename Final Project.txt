What success have you noted and are most proud of during the design and development of your project?
This week I was able to more fully understand what is an API, and how to work with API services. I was able to work with data that I got from rapidapi.com.
Also, I created the basic interface for my final program so it could display all the required information.
I did most of my HTML, CSS, and JS for this project.
 
What challenges have you run into during the development?
The first challenge was that I was struggling with getting data from API. I needed more understanding of how to use the service.
I also had some difficulties with working with images using DOM.
 
Name two (2) to three (3) resources that you have found useful during the course to complete tasks like this project. Why have they been especially useful to you?
First of all, developer.mozilla.org was a great source of information. It helped me with basic aspects. It helped me with DOM a lot. 
www.w3schools.com was a good source of information because I was able to have some practice there on topics that were not clear enough. It really helped me understand some Tags.
I've also been able to find some helpful things on blog.devgenius.io. It explains information so it is easy to understand. For example, Array Callback Method and Arrow Functions.
